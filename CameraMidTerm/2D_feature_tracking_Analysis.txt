1. The combination of the FAST detector and the ORB descriptor has the best overall 
timing performance. 

2. The second best performance is observed with detector FAST and the descriptor FREAK.

3. The third best performance is observed with detector FAST and the descriptor BRIEF.

The overall conclusions are drawn based on the total time and the number of matched points.
